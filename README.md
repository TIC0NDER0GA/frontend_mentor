## My process
1. Laid out all the parts of the component as basic html
2. grouped togther elements based on their relationship e.g. the image, title text, and description text
3. fixed the positioning of the elements made sure it was column for the group elements and body then centered the children
4. Changed the color of the body and qr card component to make it easier to see how I would need to add padding for the elements within the card 
5. Rounded the edges, fixed the type font, and font colors to match the image
